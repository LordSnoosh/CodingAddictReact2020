# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Using the 10 hour video instruction from Coding Addict on YouTube, I'm rebuilding my react foundations to standard.
